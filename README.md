# etch-a-sketch

Hey everyone, this is my second JavaScript project of the Odin Project curriculum. This time, I will be making a kind of Etch-a-Sketch and whiteboard crossover program, where the idea is the user will be able to draw on a canvas with their cursor. This will demonstrate my newly learned abilities of DOM manipulation and listening for events with JavaScript. And for this project, I will also be doing it without hte Odin Project's pseudocode, making it my very own project from idea to implementation. With that said, thank you for viewing this repo!
