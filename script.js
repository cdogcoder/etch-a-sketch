// Understand the problem
// The task is to create an Etch-a-Sketch
// type program (really just a whiteboard)
// where the user can use their cursor to
// draw things on a canvas. (Using Odin's
// requirements) The canvas should be a
// grid of empty squares (each of the squares
// are like pixels on a screen essentially)
// and upon hovering over any one of them 
// with the cursor, the square gets filled
// in. The user should also be able to determine
// the size of the canvas, or how many squares 
// the width and the length the canvas should be
// (ex. if the user picks 15 as the size, the
// generated canvas will have a width and length
// of 15 squares). The creation of the canvas and
// the "square fill" effect when hovering over the
// squares should be done through DOM manipulation.
